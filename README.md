This is a thing I made.

It uses Electron.

You'll be able to download Mac, Windows, and Linux executables at some point.

Until then, contact me to get a download, or download the source and node package manager, and then use `npm install && npm start` to run it right there. You can also create an executable yourself if you want; look up how to do that.
